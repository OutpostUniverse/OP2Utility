	// Implementation Notes
	// --------------------

	// Note: the linkOrData array contains both link data and code data. If the value is
	//  less than nodeCount then the value represents the index of the node which is
	//  the left child of the current node and value+1 represents the index of the
	//  node which is the right child of the current node.
	//  If the value is greater or equal to nodeCount then the current node is a
	//  terminal node and the code stored in this node is value-nodeCount.

	// Note: Block Leader referse to the "rightmost" node whose count is equal to
	//  the count of the current node (before the count of the current node is
	//  updated). When restructing the tree, the current node must be swapped with
	//  the block leader before the count increase is propagated up the tree. The
	//  node to the right is considered the node with the next highest index.

	// Note: Since the tree is fully formed upon initialization and all terminal nodes
	//  have a count of at least 1, there is never a case in which the block leader
	//  is the parent of the current node (since the parent's count must be at least
	//  1 greater than either of it's two subtress, which both exist). Thus such a check
	//  does not need to be performed when swapping the current node with the block leader.

	// Note: The parentIndex array contains more entries than the other two. Entries below
	//  nodeCount are used to find the parent of a given node. Entries above nodeCount
	//  (up to nodeCount + terminalNodeCount) are used to find the node which contains
	//  a given code. i.e. the "parent" of the code.

	// Note: Parents are always to the "right" of their children. Also every node except
	//  the root has a sibling. Nodes with a higher count value are always found further
	//  to the right in the tree. Thus the tree maintains the Sibling Property.
